# blender-assets-previewfix
Bulk re-orientation of all assets.

When you setup or import Assets to your AssetBrowser, you may have assets that appear with proper rotation in the file, but the orientation is wrong in the thumbnail preview.  This will correct that.

You have to open your Blender Asset file to use this.  This is the file with all the assets in it.  The assets have to be marked as assets, of course.

Place the code file (Python) in a folder you can access.  Then use Preferences, and 'Install from Disk' to install.  To access, you just click on 'Assets' in the AssetBrowser to find the button.

This will work with Blender version 4.3 and perhaps version 4.2.
